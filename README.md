Experienced Software Developer with 3 years of professional experience in developing and deploying web, mobile, and desktop applications. Specializing in Flutter/Dart, I excel in creating intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces and have a strong foundation in UI/UX design. My technical skills extend to backend development, where I utilize Python, SQL, and FastAPI to build robust systems. I have successfully contributed to projects like NAAB.app, RemoteOS.io, and LACTIVITY, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality, scalable software solutions. Passionate about continuous learning and staying current with industry trends, I am eager to leverage my comprehensive skill set to drive innovation in dynamic and collaborative environments.
