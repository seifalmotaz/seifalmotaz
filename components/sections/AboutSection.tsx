            I am Seif Almotaz Bellah Mohamed, a passionate Software Developer
            with over {calculateDuration('2022-01-01', false)} years of

            My expertise spans across Flutter, Python, NodeJS, and Golang, with
            a focus on creating scalable, high-quality solutions that deliver
            exceptional user experiences. Throughout my career, I have led the
            full lifecycle development of cross-platform applications,
            contributing to innovative projects like NAAB and RemoteOS at
            PayRows, and improving performance and stability for applications

            A look at all the programming languages, libraries, and tools I've
            worked with, I started programming about +
            {calculateDuration('2020-01-01', false)} ago. I have tried a few
            programming languages and technology stack, both Backend and
            Frontend.

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            I am interested in learning Backend with other language like Java, Go or with Python. I also want to know how to make a video game with Unity or other and I am very interested in being a content creator whether programming or something else.
          </p>

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            For now I'm learning how to make applications with real time communication such as a chat using Socket.IO, I'm also starting to learn the way to be Devops using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS or others.
          </p>

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            I am also interested in learning other things besides programming such as 3D design with Blender and video editing with Davinci Resolve (these last two I would take as a hobby).
